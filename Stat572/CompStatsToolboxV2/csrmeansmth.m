function [smth] = csrmeansmth(x,y,N)

% CSRMEANSMTH    Running mean smooth
%
%	yhat = CSRMEANSMTH(X,Y,N) constructs a running mean smoother for the
%	predictor values X and the response values Y. The smoothness of the
%	resulting nonparametric regression is governed by the number of points
%	N. 
%
%   Note that this is a symmetric neighborhood, so the number of points in
%   the neighborhood is actually 2*N + 1.
%
%	INPUTS:		X is a vector of predictor values
%				Y is a vector of response values
%				N is the number of points
%
%   The ouput of this function is a vector YHAT of smoothed values at the
%   observed X values.
%
%   A plot of the data points and smooth is also produced by this function.
%
%   EXAMPLE:
%
%   load vineyard
%   y = totlugcount;
%   x = row;
%   yhat = csrmeansmth(x,y,3);
