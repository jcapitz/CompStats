%   TREE = CSGROWC(X,MAXN,CLAS,NK,PRIORS)
%
%   This function grows a classification tree.
%   X is a matrix containing the cases, along with a class label.
%   Each row contains a case. The first d columns of X correspond
%   to the variables/features and the last column is the class
%   label.
%   MAXN is the maximum number of cases allowed in a terminal node
%   if they do not all belong to the same class.
%   CLAS is a vector of numeric class labels: 1, 2, ...
%   NK is the number of cases in each class.
%   PRIORS is a vector of prior probabilities for each class. If this
%   is not provided, then the priors are estimated based on the 
%   number in each class.
