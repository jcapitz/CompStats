%	R = CSSAMPLE(X,P,N) This function will take an arbitrary discrete.
%	finite distribution and return a random sample from it. 
%	The domain of the function is X. These are the values that the random 
%	variable can assume. The probability associated with each one is given in the
% 	vector P. The number of variates that will be generated is N.
