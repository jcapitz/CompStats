% CSSTRAUSSPROC Generates a Strauss spatial point process.

%
%   This function returns X and Y locations for a process
%   that exhibits regularity. This follows the Strauss process
%   model. XP and YP are the vertices of the boundary region.
%   DELTA is the inhibition distance. N is the number of
%   points to generate. C is the inhibition parameter that must
%   be between 0 and 1.
