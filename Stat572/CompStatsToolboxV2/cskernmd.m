% CSKERNMD	Product kernel.
%
%	PROB = CSKERNMD(X,DATA,H)
%	This returns the product kernel probability density estimate for a d-dimensional 
%	point x based on the data. Here, d >= 2.
%
%	X represents the point(s) in the domain where you want to get the value of the probability.
%	Thus, X is nn x d, where d is the dimensionality.
%	DATA is the n x d data matrix, where each row is an observation.
%	H is an optional vector of window widths, one for each dimension. The default is the
%	value obtained from the Normal Reference Rule.
