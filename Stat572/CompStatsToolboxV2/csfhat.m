%
%   This function returns an estimate of the F function, ignoring
%   edge effects. The input argument X contains the event locations.
%   DOM contains the domain over which to evaluate the FHAT function.
%   M specifies the number of random points in the region to sample.
%   REGION is the boundary of the study region.
