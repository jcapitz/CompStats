function Z = cshist2d(x,flag,h)
% CSHIST2D  Bivariate histogram.
%
%   Z = CSHIST2D(DATA,FLAG,H)
%
%   Constructs a bivariate histogram using the observed DATA. Each row
%   of DATA corresponds to a bivariate observation. 
%   H is the smoothing parameter. This is optional. The default is the 
%   Normal Reference Rule bin width.
%   FLAG indicates what type of plot to provide: 1 = SURF,2 = Square bins
%   
%   X and Y provide the coordinates of the bins. Z is the height of the
%   histogram.

%   Revision 1/02 - Fixed bug for axes - they were set at (-3,3) for the
%   standard normal. Removed the X and Y axes limits. 

%   Revision 1/02  - A user wrote in with a problem: the surface was not plotting. The
%   data had a covariance matrix where one variance was 1400 and the other
%   was 600. This resulted in 1 bin for each direction, using the default h. When the default
%   bin width calculation yields too few bins, the user needs to input 
%   the window widths, h. Put in some code to catch this.
