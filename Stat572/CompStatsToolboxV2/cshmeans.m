function [cid,nr,centers] = cshmeans(x,k,nc)
% CSHMEANS K-means clustering.
%
%   [CID,NR,CENTERS] = CSHMEANS(X,K,NC) Performs K-means
%   clustering using the data given in X. 
%   
%   INPUTS: X is the n x d matrix of data,
%   where each row indicates an observation. K indicates
%   the number of desired clusters. NC is a k x d matrix for the
%   initial cluster centers. If NC is not specified, then the
%   centers will be randomly chosen from the observations.
%
%   OUTPUTS: CID provides a set of n indexes indicating cluster
%   membership for each point. NR is the number of observations
%   in each cluster. CENTERS is a matrix, where each row
%   corresponds to a cluster center.
