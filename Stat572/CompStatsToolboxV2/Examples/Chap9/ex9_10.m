% First create the model.
% The function expects a vector of weights;
% a matrix of means, where each column of the matrix
% corresponds to a d-D mean; a 3-D array of 
% covariances, where each page of the array is a
% covariance matrix.
pies = [0.5 0.3 0.2]; % mixing coefficients
mus=[-1 1 5; -1 1 6];
% Delete any previous variances in the workspace.
